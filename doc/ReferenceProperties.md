### Reference Properties

Unlike scalar properties, reference properties establish link between 2 objects, so value of reference property is another object.
There are few subtypes of reference properties:

- regular reference properties

- nested objects

- mixins

All reference properties are internally stored and accessed the same way, thus alowing few interesting possibilities with schema
refactoring.
